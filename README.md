# E-Commerce Sales Performance Analysis 2019

## Project Overview
This project analyzes E-commerce website sales performance for 2019 to identify key trends, consumer insights, and category/item performance. The goal is to provide an overview of a yearâ€™s worth of online sales and derive actionable insights for optimizing product offerings, marketing strategies, and inventory management. The final dashboard visualizes the data in an easy-to-understand format.

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel**: Data cleaning, pivot tables, charts, and dashboard creation.

## Data Source
The dataset is fictional and sourced from Kaggle. You can access it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naofilahmad/sales-datset-product-sample).

## About the Dataset
The dataset is a collection of raw E-commerce sales data from the year 2019. It contains 13 columns:
- Order ID
- Product Category
- Product
- Quantity Ordered
- Price Each
- Order Date
- Purchase Address
- Month
- Sales
- City
- Hour
- Time of Day

With 178,437 orders placed throughout the year, the dataset was messy and required significant cleaning before meaningful analysis could take place. After cleaning, the data provided valuable insights into consumer purchasing behavior.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Removed blanks and unnecessary columns.
   - Refined product categories.
   - Found and corrected spelling errors.
   - Eliminated unwanted spaces and standardized formats (numbers, dates).
   - Distinguished a same city name in two different states.
   - Extracted additional columns such as city, state, and zip codes from the purchase address.
   - Removed hard-coded cells to ensure data consistency.

2. **Pivot Tables**:
   - Created summary tables for revenue and quantity sold across categories, products, cities, states, months, and time periods.

3. **Dashboard**:
   - Designed a professional dashboard with the following charts:
     - **Revenue by Product Category** (Bar Chart)
     - **Revenue Trends by Month** (Line Chart)
     - **Revenue Distribution by Time of Day** (Pie Chart)
     - **State Performance: Revenue vs. Quantity Sold** (Combo Chart)
